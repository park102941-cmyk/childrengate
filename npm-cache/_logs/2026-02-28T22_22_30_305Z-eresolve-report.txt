# npm resolution error report

While resolving: children-gate@0.1.0
Found: react@19.2.4
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.5.1 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from lucide-react@0.344.0
node_modules/lucide-react
  dev lucide-react@"0.344.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
